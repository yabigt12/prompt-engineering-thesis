<h1>[PROJECT INFORMATION]</h1>
<p>Project Description Long: Who knows whether their vaccination status is right, when another dentist appointment is due or when cancer screening is due? Even we felt the same way. That's why we invented the APPzumARZT. It keeps track of your prevention status, reminds you of check-ups, vaccinations and dental checks, helping you to retain your bonus benefits and - of course - to stay healthy. And with the integrated FOCUS-Gesundheit doctor search, you can find the right doctor right away. The APPzumARZT is the automatic health manager that reminds you of all vaccinations, preventive measures, U/J examinations and dental appointments. An app for all prevention services of your statutory health insurance. It doesn't matter which one! Including the FOCUS health doctor search.</p>
<p>Project Description Short: All prevention appointments. In an app. For the whole family.</p>
<p>Challenge: Develop an app that is so user-friendly and understandable that more people use the preventive services of statutory health insurance companies and thus create greater awareness of preventive health measures.</p>
