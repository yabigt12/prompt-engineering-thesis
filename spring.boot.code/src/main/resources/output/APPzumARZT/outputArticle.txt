<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The software development company iteratec has implemented a project for the customer [CUSTOMER].

The app aims to create greater awareness of preventive health measures and encourage more people to utilize the preventive services offered by statutory health insurance companies.</p>
<p>What sets APPzumARZT apart is its comprehensive approach to prevention services, catering to the needs of the whole family. With the integrated FOCUS-Gesundheit doctor search, users can easily find the right doctor for their specific needs.
